# ReactPortfolio

## Description

A react based portfolio.

## User Story

As a web developer looking to show off my skills to potential employers, I want a website that showcases these skills and allows the person engaging with it to see information about me, about my projects, and about hot to contact me.


## Table of Contents
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Demo](#demo)
* [Contact](#contact)

## Usage

It's a fairly straightforward portfolio. The navbar contains links to different pages which are rendered in the body with the use of hashrouting. The navbar, background, and footer are static thanks to reacts functionality.


## Demo

The index page of the application looks like this:

![about](https://github.com/luvwitch/ReactPortfolio/blob/main/public/about.jpg?raw=true)

You can view projects I've worked on in the Portfolio section. Clicking on the images will take you to the live deployment of the project, and clicking on the title takes you to the project's repository.

Accessing the Contact page shows all of my relevant contact info with links to my github, linkedin, and a link which opens the users email app and drafts a new email with me as the recipient.
